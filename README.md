# Workout Tracker
This program is a built in double-user workout tracker which tracks progress over time, separated by users, predicts 1REP maxes using the Brzycki formula, and implements various data structures like dictionaries and lists.

# The Process
1) Start by inputting a user by inputting 4.
2) Choose a username and put in your bodyweight
3) Then, add lifts by pressing 2
4) You will need to input which type of lift it is (Squat/Bench/Deadlift), your rep count and the amount of weight
5) Using the Brzycki formula, your max lift will be estimated
6) Then, repeat 3-5 to add another lift, or press 1 to view lifts
7) Additionally, if you need to add another user, repeat steps 1 and 2

# Creates the log to store users and lifts
workout_logs = {}
